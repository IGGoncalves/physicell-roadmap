Welcome to this wiki! :wave: We will be going through how to start your journey with PhysiCell.

PhysiCell is an **open-source, agent-based modelling framework for 3-D multicellular simulations**. It is written in C++ and it comes with multiple code examples that will help you understand how to build your own model. There are some very good [official tutorials](http://physicell.org/tutorials/), that are definitely worth checking out, as well as two user guides (found inside the PhysiCell repository - we will talk about them later). 

However, these resources can be a bit overwhelming, and it may be difficult to understand where to start. Therefore, **the goal of this wiki is to help you make the most of the official resources**, by guiding you through them, while also providing some **additional information** that I wish I had had when I started using this piece of software. However, it **does not replace PhysiCell's original documentation**!

Here is a list of the topics we will focus on. Preferably, you should go through them in **sequential order**, but it is not essential. If you have a specific question, just go through the page that covers the topic you need to clarify. You can also find these links listed on the left side of the wiki.

!!! info
    Before starting, check out this brief [programming review](programming-review.md) to brush up on some concepts that will be useful when running simulations.
