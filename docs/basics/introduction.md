## Main resources
In my opinion, the most "user-friendly" way of getting to know PhysiCell is to **watch one of the lectures taught by Paul Macklin**, PhysiCell's main investigator:

You can also check his [YouTube account](https://www.youtube.com/c/PaulMacklin_MathCancer/) for some additional videos of PhysiCell simulations.

Next, you should **take a look at the [original publication](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005991)**. Don't worry, you do not need to understand every single detail at first (and you won't need to in order to work with the code). Yet, it is very important that you are aware of what PhysiCell is and what it can do, so read the paper and try to at least retain this information.

When you feel like you can start **a more "hands-on" approach**, you will need to get the PhysiCell code. You can find the most recent release of the code on their [website](http://physicell.org/), or through their [GitHub page](https://github.com/MathCancer/PhysiCell).
