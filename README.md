# PhysiCell Roadmap
> :construction: Currently under development

A PhysiCell wiki that aims to guide you through PhysiCell's official resources and provide you with some additional information that I wish I had known when I started working with PhysiCell.

Visit the wiki @ https://iggoncalves.github.io/physicell-roadmap/

Check out PhysiCell @ http://physicell.org/ and don't forget to check their original publication and cite it when you use this framework!
